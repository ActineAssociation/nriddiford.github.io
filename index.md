# About
Actin Art - **L’association des Artistes et des Scientifiques Actine** - is a science communication project that combines science and art. It aims to raise general public interest in the sciences and explain recent scientific discoveries. We are creating a series of short, illustrated, science-based books that accurately relay science via fun, adventure stories for 3-5 year olds.

As the science is accurate, the parents and teachers reading the stories to the children will learn too, and be better able to explain the science to the children. The characters in our stories are the real molecules, proteins and cells that scientists study in the lab. Our aim is that these books will inspire children and adults to become as excited as we are by cells, molecules and biology in general!

# People
We are a group of scientists, mostly based at the Institut Curie in Paris, who have a passion for communicating our work to the general public.

# School workshops
We recently held a workshop at the Lyonnais nursery located in the 5th arrondissement in Paris. After around 15 minutes of storytelling with our artwork, we held activities that related to some of our stories. This was a huge success, and the children we really engaged with our stories. After following-up with the school three months later we were delighted to discover that the children remembered some of the key concepts from our stories!

The school was very grateful for our involvement, and is looking forward to our next workshop – as are we! In fact, we would like to hold similar sessions in other nurseries (ages 3 – 5) around Paris. If you would like to invite us to hold one at your school – please contact us!

# Books
We have been working very hard on publishing some of our stories, and are delighted to announce that the first three – part of the Jeunesse Esprits Curieux collection – will be published in November 2018!
These books are aimed at children aged 3+, and have been written by members of our group – working scientists who are specialists in their field and want to help children (and adults) become excited about science. For each book, the author and illustrator have worked hard to make the story both scientifically accurate, as well as exciting and beautiful.

# Exhibitions 
To complement the books we are publishing, and to celebrate the beautiful artwork each book contains, we are planning an exhibition 'Le Jardin de Curiosites'. This will take place in in September or October 2018 in the Jardin Curie at the Institut Curie. If you  would like to attend – follow us on social media to keep updated!
